Understanding how individual cells respond to therapy, in real time, is one of the biggest challenges in cancer biology. 
Traditional bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing provide powerful snapshots of gene expression, but they struggle to distinguish 
**newly activated transcriptional programs** from long-lived, pre-existing RNA. This limitation makes it difficult to capture 
the earliest molecular decisions that determine whether a cell becomes sensitive, resistant, or committed to cell death.

This project introduces a **nascent single-cell RNA sequencing framework** designed to overcome that challenge. 
By combining **metabolic RNA labelling** with **single-cell sequencing**, we directly measure newly synthesised RNA at 
single-cell resolution. This enables a time-resolved view of transcriptional activity — revealing how cells dynamically 
respond to stress, drugs, and environmental cues, rather than relying on steady-state expression alone.

In the paper, we apply this approach in a **physiologically relevant 3D tumour model**, preserving tumour 
architecture and the native tumour microenvironment. Using ex vivo tumoroids derived from a genetically engineered 
mouse model of breast cancer, we profile transcriptional responses to chemotherapy across thousands of individual cells,
spanning epithelial, immune, endothelial, and stromal populations.

Crucially, this work extends nascent RNA sequencing to **scalable single-cell platforms**, including a newly developed 
pipeline compatible with **microwell-based technologies**, such as BD-Rhapsody. This fills a major methodological gap 
between low-throughput plate-based methods and rigid droplet-based workflows, making nascent single-cell analysis 
more accessible for complex tissues and large datasets.

Overall, this resource is intended for researchers who want to investigate **dynamic gene regulation** in 
heterogeneous cell populations by applying **nascent RNA sequencing** to heterogeneous tissues. 
Specifically, it bioinformatics steps for analysing nascent single-cell RNA-seq data generated using:
- BD Rhapsody or similar microwell-based single-cell platforms
- Using 4sU-based metabolic labelling to track **newly transcribed RNA** as per scNT-seq
